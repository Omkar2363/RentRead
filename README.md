- `entities` : Contains the entity classes.
- `controllers`: Handles incoming HTTP requests and responses.
- `services`: Contains the logic for managing users books and rentals.
- `repositories`: Interacts with the MySQL Database.
- `exceptions` : Contains the custom exceptions and exception handler classes.
